1. How to create branch and switch the new branch:

git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/branchname --> git checkout -b feature/addReservationFunctionallity

🛠️ Commit & Push Workflow (Safe Way)

1. Update Your Local Code Before Work
Always start by syncing with your team’s latest code:

git checkout main
git pull origin main

2. Create Your Own Branch
Never work directly on main. Create a feature branch:

git checkout -b feature/add-login

3. Work & Commit Changes
Stage and commit regularly:

git add .
git commit -m "Added login UI"

💡 Good commit message rules:
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update)
- Be clear (Fix null bug in login API)
- Don’t just write "changes" ❌

4. Push to GitHub
Push your branch (not main):
